Testing the resilience of the good-fitness of fishing activity by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Andalusia region (Spain).


Our main aim is to test the resilience of fishing activity to the COVID-19 pandemic in two different Andalusian fishing grounds (Atlantic and Mediterranean ones). We analyzed daily landings and fresh first-market-prices of the most caught species in both fishing grounds, taking into account the different seasonal behavior of the fisheries and comparing the different period of the pandemic (2020-2021) using Generalized Linear Models.
